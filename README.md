# Word-Autocomplete
This is a word autocomplete program created in Python. It is implemented using a dictionary to imitate a Trie data structure.

## Future Additions:

  * Implementation of a feature to input part of a word and the program returns words that can be constructed using that text as a prefix.
  * Implementation of a database to store the words that make up the trie. Accessing these words will be done using SQL.
  * Adding a popularity mesaure to each word in the database that can be used to order the list of return candidate words. (For the purpose of updating the database and making the returned list more useful)
